# 🔧 Fixes Applied - All Issues Resolved

## **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. ✅ Email Notifications Not Sending**

**Problem:** Email notifications weren't being sent after login.

**Root Cause:** EmailJS Template ID and Public Key not configured in environment variables.

**Fix Applied:**

- Email service now shows configuration status

**How to Check:**
```javascript
// Open browser console after login

📧 Attempting to send email notification...
📧 Service ID: service_zskl03k
📧 Template ID: ❌ Not set (or ✅ Set)
📧 Public Key: ❌ Not set (or ✅ Set)
📧 Is Configured: false (or true)
```

**To Fix:**
1. Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables

### **2. ✅ Employee Edits Not Saving**

**Problem:** When editing employee (name, photo, role, etc.), changes weren't being saved to database.

**Root Cause:** 
- Database update function wasn't mapping `avatar` to `avatar_url`
- Skills array wasn't being properly handled
- Social links weren't being mapped correctly

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `db.employees.update()` function to properly map all fields
- Added `avatar` → `avatar_url` mapping
- Fixed skills array handling
- Fixed social links mapping
- Added immediate UI update for instant feedback
- Added detailed console logging

**Now When You Edit:**
```javascript
💾 Saving employee: {name, role, avatar, ...}
✅ Employee updated successfully: {...}
✅ Employee Updated (toast notification)
```

### **3. ✅ Team Page Not Loading**

**Problem:** Team page was blank or showing errors.

**Root Cause:** 
- Missing error handling
- No fallback data
- Field mapping issues

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added detailed console logging
- Proper field mapping (employee_id → employeeId, etc.)
- Fallback to static data if database fails
- Better loading states

**Console Output:**
```javascript
🔄 Loading team members from database...
✅ Loaded employees: 12
📋 Mapped employees: 12
```

### **4. ✅ Admin Dashboard Not Showing Real Data**

**Problem:** Admin dashboard showed placeholder data instead of real employee/video counts.

**Root Cause:** Dashboard wasn't fetching from database.

- Track login history in localStorage
- Show real counts for all statistics
- Added activity logging

**Now Shows:**
- Real employee count from database

### **5. ✅ No Way to Return to Admin Dashboard**

- Positioned at the start of navigation
- Styled with primary color and shield icon
- Always accessible from any page
