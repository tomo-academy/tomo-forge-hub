- UI updates instantly
- Both `avatar` and `avatar_url` fields updated
- Automatic reload from database for consistency

### **3. Database Status Shows "Connected"**

**Before:**
- Status unclear
- Mock data used even with database

**After:**
- Shows "Connected" when database available
- Real employee count
- Real video count
- All statistics from database

## **📊 What's Now Using Real Data:**

### **Dashboard (`/dashboard`):**
1. **Revenue Card:**
   - Total Revenue (from `revenue` table)
   - Ad Revenue
   - Sponsorships
   - Memberships
   - Merchandise
   - Courses

2. **Activities Feed:**
   - Recent team activities (from `activities` table)
   - User actions
   - Timestamps
   - Activity types

3. **Analytics:**
   - Subscribers (from `analytics` table)
   - Views
   - Watch Time
   - Engagement
   - Videos Published
   - Tasks Completed
   - Team Productivity

### **Admin Dashboard (`/admin`):**
1. **Statistics Cards:**
   - Total Employees (from `employees` table)
   - Total Videos (from `videos` table)
   - Recent Logins (from localStorage)
   - Database Status (real connection check)

2. **Recent Activity:**
   - Login events

## **🔧 How It Works:**

### **Data Fetching Flow:**
```javascript
1. Check if database connection exists
   ↓
2. If yes → Query database for real data
   ↓
3. If data exists → Return real data ✅
   ↓
4. If no data → Create initial records
   ↓
5. If database unavailable → Use fallback data
```

### **Photo Update Flow:**
```javascript
1. User uploads photo
   ↓
2. Photo service uploads to storage
   ↓
3. Get photo URL
   ↓
4. Update both avatar and avatar_url in database
   ↓
5. Update local state immediately (instant UI feedback)
   ↓
6. Reload from database (ensure consistency)
   ↓
7. Photo visible everywhere ✅
```

## **📝 Database Tables Used:**

### **1. Revenue Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE revenue (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  month TEXT NOT NULL,
  year INTEGER NOT NULL,
  total_revenue DECIMAL(10, 2),
  ad_revenue DECIMAL(10, 2),
  sponsorships DECIMAL(10, 2),
  memberships DECIMAL(10, 2),
  merchandise DECIMAL(10, 2),
  courses DECIMAL(10, 2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(month, year)
);
```

### **2. Activities Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE activities (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT REFERENCES employees(id),
  user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('video', 'task', 'team', 'system')),
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **3. Analytics Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE analytics (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  date DATE UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  subscribers INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  views INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  watch_time INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  engagement DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  revenue DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  videos_published INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  tasks_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  team_productivity DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## **✨ Auto-Initialization:**

If tables are empty, the system automatically creates initial records:

### **Revenue:**
```javascript
{
  month: "October",
  year: 2025,
  totalRevenue: 3247,
  adRevenue: 2156,
  sponsorships: 891,
  memberships: 200,
  merchandise: 0,
  courses: 0
}
```

### **Activities:**
```javascript
[
  {
    userName: "Kanish SJ",
    action: "uploaded new video",
    title: "Firebase Tutorial - Part 5",
    type: "video"
  },
  {
    userName: "Kamesh AJ",
    action: "completed design task",
    title: "Thumbnail for Tech Review",
    type: "task"
  },
  {
    userName: "Ajay Krithick",
    action: "reviewed and approved",
    title: "Script: AI in Education",
    type: "task"
  }
]
```

### **Analytics:**
```javascript
{
  date: "2025-10-14",
  subscribers: 125000,
  views: 5600000,
  watchTime: 500000,
  engagement: 87.5,
  revenue: 3247,
  videosPublished: 234,
  tasksCompleted: 89,
